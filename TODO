rename library to springboard

separate icons and folders into two different types

add an extended type function (???)

change icon type to app type with an icon field






-- extend type to handle these new "classes"
-- add dump function to src

-- add a fetch icon to the icon object -- but that needs the connection object .... can we create the function
-- with the conn as an upvalue ???

-- get dock and page #


-- have a flow (or fill) function that pours a list into pages ... have a percent fill parameter so that pages/folders are filled
-- to that percentage...
